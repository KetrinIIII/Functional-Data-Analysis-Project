This project explores the application of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) on spectrometric data from meat samples to investigate the relationship between absorbance spectra and chemical composition (fat, water, and protein content). By employing smoothing, functional principal component analysis (fPCA), and other FDA methods, the project aims to identify key spectral features, reduce dimensionality, and develop predictive models that can accurately assess meat quality based on spectrometric data.
